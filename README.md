# Overview

This project is meant to get me started on my software portfolio. I am going to be creating a series of basic projects across various programming languages to expand my repertoire.

This program prints the traditional "Hello World!" message, but I have added in some flair that gives it a cascading rainbow effect using loops and the colorama library.

For this program, I wanted to create something that could be somewhat easily accomplished while still demonstrating some level of understanding and skill.

Here's a link to a demonstration of the code:
